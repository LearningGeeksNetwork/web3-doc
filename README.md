What is Web3 from a technical point of view? Web3 is the juxtaposition of Web2.0 (Described by Tim O'Reilly)  and DLT (example Ethereum) and DHT (example IPFS, Holochain) technologies.

Dr. Gavin Wood proposed a definition of the Web3. A picture is worth a thousand words.

# Main Web3 Skills : 

**Frontend** Web 2.0  —>  Typescript, JavaScript, React.js, VueJS, Angular, Next.js, NodeJS, Ethers.js,  ...

**Backend**  Smart-Contracts —>  Solidity (EVM), Rust, WASM, ...

**Infrastructure** & Cryptography —>  GoLang, Rust, C/C++, ...

Distributed Hash Table (DHT) 
Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) 

**Network DLT**  —>   Ethereum 2.0, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche, Polkadot/Substrate (EVM Moonbeam), BigchainDB,  Cardano, Tezos, ZK-Rollups (zkSync, StarkNet, Aztec), KSI Blockchain - e-Estonia, ...

**Network DHT** —>  IPFS, Holochain

**IDE** :  Visual Studio Code, HardHat, Truffle Suite

**Wallets** :  Software Wallet MetaMask, Hardware Wallet Ledger

What is the problem : take control of our life and our data.

#  The Basics of Web3 Technologies:
   - P2P distributed systems
   - Distributed Hash Table (DHT) 
   - Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) 
   - Cryptography
   - Mechanism Design , Game theory
   - Tokenomics
   - DAO Community

#  The main pillars of Web3 projects:
   - Open Source, 
   - Transparency,  ( Transparency does not mean lack of Privacy )
   - Decentralization, 
   - Disintermediation,
   - Community
   - Ownership
   - User Centric
   
#  Blockchain 1.0
- Bitcoin (2009) —> Cryptocurrencies

#  Blockchain 2.0
- Ethereum (2014) —> Smart-Contracts   

# Blockchain 3.0
- Mutichains, Internet of Blockchains (example Polkadot and COSMOS/Tendermint)
- Scalability (Transactions Per Second, Net bandwidth, Data Size),
- Interoperability Multi-Chain, Cross-chain compatibility, 
-Sustainability, DAO Community for future development; 
-Deterministic finality
- Layer 2
- ZK-Rollups, ...

#  Tokenomics
   - Categories of Tokens
   - Decentralized Marketplace
   - DAO Community

#  The value proposition
    - Reduce censorship and empower people.

It is about using technology to bring value back to artists, workers and reduce censorship from the few. It is about democratizing art, music with the power of Blockchain technology.

#  TOKENS  Categories 

![alt TOKENS  Categories BRI](imgs/photo_2022-07-06_23-51-41.jpg)

Three Sub-Categories

1- Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin
2- Tokens like Utility Tokens
3- Central Bank Tokens (CBDCs)

Do Not Forget DLT - Blockchain is a Network which manages a LinkedList called Blockchain too. Ethereum uses LinkedList with  Patricia Merkle Trees ...
